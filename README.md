# hello-world
My very first published program(ish)

I used to live in a tiny box, but then I left that box and ventured overseas, and realised how small that box had actually been.
Now I seek opportunities daily and with a constant desire to learn and evolve.

I have always wanted to work in a field that I was actually interested in, yet I am in my 30s and never have.
Then I discovered programming, and created a new goal for myself. 

I am hoping to become a Java Developer and my course application has been submitted. Why Java? Well I started with c# and found the 
syntax rather enjoyable and discovered its similarities with Java. I'm sure there are other programming languages that will
intrigue me in the future, but one step at a time my friend.

To be continued... shortly.
